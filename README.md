## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

Here's how you can use the project:

Edit the config.json file to provide your Internshala username and password.
Run the automation script

If you're looking to add more job categories to the job list in your code, you can simply extend the list by adding the desired categories. 

Replace the placeholders 'Customize your answer for the software development category here.' with your custom answer for each category. Similarly, if you have more categories, add them following the same structure.

As for the chromedriver path, replace '/path/to/your/chromedriver' with the actual path to the chromedriver executable on your system. Make sure the path is accurate and points to the location of the chromedriver file on your machine.

Once you've made these customizations, your automation script will be ready to use with personalized answers for different categories and the correct chromedriver path.
